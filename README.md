To use this you'll need to be part of a live Skiller Whale coaching session, and
have installed Docker for your computer.

Then:

* copy this into a file called `attendance_id`;
* run `docker compose up` in one window;
* run `docker compose run java` in another window;
* open your code editor in the `exercises` folder.

You should see the words "Sync Active" in the top right of your coaching session.
If not, please ask the coach for help.

After this any changes you make to your exercises will be sent to the coach
during the session.
